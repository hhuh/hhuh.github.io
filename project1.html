							Studies have shown that a success of dieting is boiled down to maintaining a consistent caloric deficit. Thus, calorie counting is an effective strategy to ensure that the dieting effort is successful. With mobile devices, it is easier than ever to obtain and log such information. However, given how eating habits can be frequent and unpredictable, the experience of logging every food item must flow smoothly. For this assignment, I examine how the user logs their food items, identify key aspects of the process and prototype a solution.

						<h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
						<p>To identify the problem, I had a target user to use the product in front of me. He is in his early 30's, very health-conscious and had used the app before. After having dinner, I tasked him to submit the meal he just had. After he had finished the task, I tasked him to submit food items he had earlier in the day as well.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Meal</h3>
								<p>Before the user can submit a food item, he must first pick out which meal the food item was eaten as. There was a brief moment of pause, as the user was scanning past the extraneous information for the button that would allow him to select the meal. After pressing plus sign on the bottom right corner, he pressed 'Food' along the 5 options, then selected 'Dinner' among 4 more options.</p>

								<h3>Food Item</h3>
								<p>The user searches for the food items to submit as part of his meal. There were few factors that made the search easier. There was a history tab, allowing him to scroll through previous entries without having to look up for them individually. Food items from chainrestaurants have their nutrition facts accurately recorded by the label, highlighted with a green check mark. However, in a lot cases, the food is from a local restaurant without an official nutrition fact labels. The user had difficulty determining which entry was the closest to resembling his current meal. The user often selected the first option if it looked accurate enough.</p>

								<h3>Serving Size & Number</h3>
								<p>User enters the number of servings of their meal. He ignored the option to adjust the serving size as entering the number of servings was more relevant to him in terms of the end goal. He was focused on approximating his caloric intake from each food item, which inputting the number of servings was the fastest way to make that approximation.</p>

								<p>Firstly, when adding the entry, the user confused the '+' button as the appropriate step when in reality, it lead to adding a brand new recipe/food to the database. The user was quickly able to go back by pressing the 'X' button when a new window showed up.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="box style2">
								<p>Secondly, the user is overwhelmed with options when searching the database. Most entries are very similar, only differing in nutrition facts and their sources. The fact that most entries have the exact same string as the query, it was difficult to make a quick decision on what is correct.</p>

								<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
								<p>The key takeaway from the contextual inquiry and modeling was to streamline the food submission process and minimalize the UI to highlight key information and tasks. I had sought to utilize many features that a mobile phone is able to have, such as geolocational information along with time of the day. In addition, I wanted to reduce the number of button presses and screens to make the submission easier and faster within a meal.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<header>
						<h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
						<span class="image"><img src="images/pt0.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<div class="col-8 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Main Hub</h3>
								<p>The prototype has been simplified to only show key information. It displays both the caloric intake and macronutrients at a glance. More importantly, the access to submitting a food entry is clearly visible and within reach. By taking note of the time of the day, the app adepts to make certain meal of the day easier to spot.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Searching</h3>
								<p>The search option now has the tabs to switch between different meals. This was intended to make entering food items faster and easier if the user were to add food items from more than one meal. The geolocational feature was also added, making it easier to find restaurants and add multiple food items within one location. In addition to History and Recipes, Favorite tab was also added for quicker access for food that are eaten on habitual basis.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Entry Options</h3>
								<p>The prototype has few entry options. If the user were to select a specific restaurant, its menu will be displayed. Within the resturant menu, it is sorted in categories as a menu would. When a food item is selected, rather than being taken to another screen, a small drop down is displayed (as the red sticky notes). From there, the user can scan for information quickly and add or favorite the item. In most cases, users do not eat only one food item for their meal but rather combine it with a drink or other appetizers. Therefore, in the notification that drops down from the top after a user adds a food item (as shown as narrow yellow strips on top), it may also suggest another food item that is frequently submitted with that food item (A sandwich with coffee in the prototype).</p>

						<h2>Prototype Evaluation</h2>
						<p>This is the final evaluation of the paper prototype with the same user from the contextual inquiry. There were 3 tasks given to the user:</p>
						<ul class="container">
							<li>Submit 2 food items for lunch: 'Hickory Avenue' sandwich and a cup of coffee from Common Grounds</li>
							<li>Submit 1 food item for breakfast: Blueberry Muffin</li>
							<li>Review the calorie remaining</li>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>Contextual inquiry was very helpful in narrowing down which information were relevant or not. It also formed the basis for the model of the user's work flow. As a low fidelity prototype, paper based prototype provided flexibility on designing the solution. The sticky notes allowed adjusting of widgets in short amount of time and forced me, the designer, to think more in terms of colors and layers. The evaluation was easy enough to carry out, however there were few limitations in evaluating with paper-based design. The design I went for was a reactive interface, showing pop-up windows and drop down menus with the screen. It was harder to transition after each button presses to show its reactive-ness and the user would often press multiple buttons before I can update the screen on time. I speculate that the paper based prototype is not an appropriate platform to test the feedback of user inputs and such would need to be prototyped later past the low-fidelity design iteration.</p>
