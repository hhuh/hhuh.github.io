							Studies have shown that a success of dieting is boiled down to maintaining a consistent caloric deficit. Thus, the calorie counting is an effective strategy to ensure that the dieting effort is successful. With mobile devices, it is easier than ever to obtain and log such information. However, given how eating habits can be frequent and unpredictable, the experience of logging every food item must flow smoothly. For this assignment, I examine how the user logs their food items, identify key aspects of the process and prototype a solution.

						<h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
						<p>To identify the problem, I had a friend use the app in front of me. He had used the app before but had not used it in years.</p>

								<h3>Meal</h3>
								<p>Before the user can submit a food item, he must first pick out which meal the food item was eaten as. There was a brief moment of pause, as the user was scanning past the extraneous information for the button that would allow him to select the meal. After pressing plus sign on the bottom right corner, he pressed 'Food' along the 5 options, then selected 'Dinner' among 4 more options.</p>

								<h3>Food Item</h3>
								<p>The user searches for the food items to submit as part of his meal. There were few factors that made the search easier. There was a history tab, allowing him to scroll through previous entries without having to look up for them individually. Food items from chainrestaurants have their nutrition facts accurately recorded by the label, highlighted with a green check mark. However, in a lot cases, the food is from a local restaurant without an official nutrition fact labels. The user had difficulty determining which entry was the closest to resembling his current meal. The user often selected the first option if it looked accurate enough.</p>

								<h3>Serving Size & Number</h3>
								<p>User enters the number of servings of their meal. He ignored the option to adjust the serving size as entering the number of servings was more relevant to him in terms of the end goal. He was focused on approximating his caloric intake from each food item, which inputting the number of servings was the fastest way to make that approximation.</p>

								<p>Firstly, when adding the entry, the user confused the '+' button as the appropriate step when in reality, it lead to adding a brand new recipe/food to the database. The user was quickly able to go back by pressing the 'X' button when a new window showed up.</p>

							<article class="box style2">
								<p>Secondly, the user is overwhelmed with options when searching the database. Most entries are very similar, only differing in nutrition facts and their sources. The fact that most entries have the exact same string as the query, it was difficult to make a quick decision on what is correct.</p>
