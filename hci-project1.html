							<p>People may no longer watch <i>America's Funniest Home Videos</i> nowadays but people share funny clips with their friends and family more than ever in the digital age. With  social interaction ever so limited during the pandemic, W2G.tv offers a service of watching video clips in real-time. For our project, we examine the current UX of such remote interaction.</p>

						<h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
						<p>We performed two instances of contextual inquiry, with a total of 5 people. To probe the remote interaction authentically, we watched the users through shared screens on Zoom. As they carried out a handful of tasks that covers the key features of the site, we observed their site interaction carefully and asked questions.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Create Room & Share Invite Link</h3>
								<p>The first step to the remote interaction is the initiative of creating a room and sharing an invite link to people. While the users did not have any trouble making a new room, they had some trouble with sharing the invite link. Locating and copying the invite link was not difficult as the users were able to find the yellow '+ Invite friends' button on the top right. However, it was sending out the link itself that gave them trouble. The users were on their work computer, thus they did not have a messaging app available right away to share the link. One user immediately turned to Gmail to share the link while the other manually typed the link on their phone in a messaging app.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Adding Videos to Playlist</h3>
								<p>Submitting a video to the playlist is a crucial interaction to the process. However, to the first time users, the task was not as obvious as it should be. On the very top screen, there is the search bar where a user can enter keywords to search YouTube videos and add videos to the playlist. One of our users commented that he did “not see any button to add a video to playlist” and struggled to figure out how to add a video directly on the w2g.tv site. Two of our users did not use the search bar immediately and instead searched the videos on YouTube itself and copied the video links. After acquiring the links to their desired video, they did not recognize that the top search bar was the place to add videos. After minutes of struggle, they finally inserted the links to the search bar, which returned the video as a search result at the bottom of the screen below the video screen. Only then were they able to add their clips to the list by clicking the '+' button. After finally adding a video, one user remarked that it was “hard for [her] to tell what the function of anything on the website was."

							<div class="col-8 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Playlist & Changing Videos</h3>
								<p>On the right of the video are the playlist and history. As the users added their videos, they were able to confirm right away that a new video was added to the queue. Most notably, when the users were searching for a place to add a video, the users looked into the playlist immediately. It is possible that the users not only expected the video adding feature to be within the playlist section but also some of the interfaces on the playlist are misleading. When prompted to skipping or replaying videos, the users were able to easily click on the desired video.</p>

							<div class="col-8 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Watching Together</h3>
								<p>While the users were able to add and switch videos, they seemed to have a small impression on the experience of watching together. One user clicked on a video in the playlist without realizing that the video changed for all the other users. The other user was in a wrong room, but did not realize it even when other users were adding videos. The entire experience was barely different from watching on YouTube itself, as one user would say. Another user commented that the video player should be more in line with the standard buttons and icons available on other platforms. Furthermore, when entering full screen mode, one user was frustrated that she could "not see the chat or playlist anymore," claiming that this "somewhat defeats the purpose of the site" because once in full screen, she could no longer interact with other users.</p>

						<h2>Model</h2>
						<p>Aside from the initial step of the room creation and invitation, the workflow of each user is identical once the users get to the core features of videos and chat. We decided to make a sequential model on how easily the users were able to carry out the desired tasks. Within the sequential model, we divided it into several sections of the key features of using the site.</p>

						<h2>Key Takeaways from the Model</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Looking at the key issues in our model, we brainstormed how to find solutions for them.</p>
						<li>In the case where direct links are inaccessible, make a room code that's short enough to manually type in.</li>
						<li>Place the video search/add functionality closer to the playlist since it seems to be the spot where most users look to.</li>
						<li>Separate the search feature and add feature separately so users can efficiently do either of them.</li>
						<li>Place the search/add GUI away from the screen so the video is still visible on screen.</li>
						<li>Make fullscreen mode available on the video control bar.</li>
						<li>In the fullscreen mode, allow access to key features such as chat and add/search.</li>
						<li>Add the react emoji option for interaction.</li>
						<li>Make the anonymous usernames more readable and make the user list bigger.</li>

							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Main Hub</h3>
								<p>In the main hub, there are clear options for creating a room and joining a room. In the orignal website, there were no option to join a room as they only rely on URL for joining. Here, we put the option of joining a room right below creating a room.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-8 col-7-large col-12-medium">
								<h3>Joining a room</h3>
								<p>If the user wants to join a room and they do not have the link, they can enter a 5-letter room code. This was designed to combat an issue where users would need extra steps to share a code if sharing the link is not directly possible.</p>

								<p>Now the site has two options of sharing a room, offering both link and a 5-letter room code. This is directly seen when a user creates a room as that is the first task most users do when they create a room.</p>

								<p>This is the main view of users being in a room together.

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>Looking over the user evaluations, it seems our prototype has successfully demonstrated the use of the product, even having a better impression than the original occasionally. Perhaps the video prototype could have added the demo of the chat feature in full-screen mode but aside from that, we believe the video was mostly clear to the users. Given our limited time with editing the video, the user had mild confusion about the YouTube clip playing in the video; however, we do not see it as an issue to our prototype itself. Overall, our prototype has gotten positive feedback, especially regarding the clarity of feature presence and usage.</p>
